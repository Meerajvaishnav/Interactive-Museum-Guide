# Interactive-Museum-Guide
A modular Python project that simulates a smart museum guide app using advanced data structures and algorithms.

Features:
1. Trie-based Search System
  Efficient exhibit search by: Name, Artist, Art style/category
  Supports prefix-based lookup (e.g., typing "Van" returns Van Gogh exhibits).
2. Browsing History with Undo/Redo
  Implements a simplified Red-Black Tree structure to store exhibit visits.
  Includes: Insert exhibit visit, Undo last visit, Redo previously undone visit
3. Shortest Path Navigation (Graph + Dijkstra)
  Simulates museum floor navigation using weighted edges.
  Finds optimal routes between exhibits.
  Uses: Weighted graph, Dijkstra’s shortest path algorithm

Tech Stack: Python, Trie (prefix search), Binary Tree (history tracking), Graph + Dijkstra (pathfinding)
